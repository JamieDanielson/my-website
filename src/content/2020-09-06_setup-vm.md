## How to set up a virtual machine

Ever wanted to try Linux but your PC is running Windows? Wanted to install some new software but didn't want to deal with uninstalling it later? That's where a virtual machine can come in. It still uses up space from your computer (the 'host' computer) but it can run a different OS like Linux without any changes needed for your computer. It's safe and easy.

The following steps are for using Oracle's VirtualBox with Ubuntu.

* Download Ubuntu LTS
  * LTS stands for long-term support. Always get LTS when you can.
  * [Ubuntu Desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
* Download VirtualBox
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
* Open VirtualBox
* Click New
  * Name: Ubuntu 18.04 (version of Ubuntu being installed)
  * Machine Folder: wherever you want to save, e.g. C:\Users\jamie\VirtualBox VMs
  * Type: Linux
  * Version: Ubuntu 64-bit
* Memory Size: 8192mb
  * this will likely vary depending on the PC
* Create Virtual Hard Disk Now
* Hard disk file type: VDI (Virtual Box Disk Image)
* Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically allocated
* File size: 20.00GB
* Settings / Storage
  * Controller: IDE
  * Create optical drive: Disk - Ubuntu ... iso
* ok
* Start
* Install Ubuntu
* Normal installation, Download updates while installing Ubuntu
* Erase disk & install Ubuntu
* Continue
* Where are you? New York
* Who are you?
  * Name: Jamie
  * Comp name: jamie-ubuntu
  * username: jamie
  * password
  * require password to log in
* Restart now (after install)
* Devices - Insert Guest Additions CD Image
  * This allows for larger screensize, sharing clipboard, etc.
  * this should already be included in the virtualbox, which you can view int he installation directory of VirtualBox VBoxGuestAdditions.iso

## Troubleshooting / Common Issues

General Rule: Google it!

* You may need to enable virtualization in BIOS.
* Check Windows Features on your host machine to enable and disable appropriate options.
* You could have a compatibility issue if you have a newer version of Ubuntu and an older VM, so updates may be needed.

Have you tried turning it off and on again?
